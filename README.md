# MPCPy
This is the development site for MPCPy, the python-based open-source platform for model predictive control in buildings.

## Description
MPCPy facilitates the testing and implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for building systems.  The software package focuses on the use of data-driven simplified physical or statistical models to predict building performance and optimize control.  Python modules and classes exist for importing data, interacting with a real or emulated system, estimating and validating data-driven models, and optimizing control inputs.
